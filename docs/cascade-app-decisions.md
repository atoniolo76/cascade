# Cascade app decisions

Owner: Amani. Scope: the Cascade app container (main mode + simulator mode shell), its API, and its UI. See [charter.md](charter.md).

Decisions are recorded as they are made. Superseded decisions are struck through with a note.

## Process

- Work happens on the `amani` branch, committed continuously.

## Stack

- Backend: Python FastAPI. Frontend: React built with Vite into static files that FastAPI serves.
- One process, one image for both main and simulator modes. Next.js was rejected because it needs a Node server next to Python in every forked sailbox, and its SSR/API-route strengths don't apply to a Python-backed dashboard.
